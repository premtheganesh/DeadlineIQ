### 6. Technical Architecture

#### 6.1 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
- **Storage:** Browser LocalStorage
- **No Backend:** Fully client-side application

#### 6.2 Data Structure
```javascript
{
  id: timestamp,
  name: string,
  className: string,
  dueDate: ISO datetime,
  gradeWeight: number (0-100),
  estimatedHours: number,
  currentGrade: number (0-100),
  priorityScore: number (calculated),
  priorityLevel: 'critical' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low',
  status: 'not_started' | 'in_progress' | 'completed',
  completedAt: timestamp,
  notes: string
}
```

#### 6.3 Priority Calculation Algorithm
```javascript
function calculatePriority(assignment) {
  // Time urgency (0-40 points)
  const hoursUntilDue = (new Date(dueDate) - now) / (1000 * 60 * 60);
  let urgencyScore = 0;
  if (hoursUntilDue < 24) urgencyScore = 40;
  else if (hoursUntilDue < 48) urgencyScore = 30;
  else if (hoursUntilDue < 72) urgencyScore = 20;
  else if (hoursUntilDue < 168) urgencyScore = 10;

  // Grade weight impact (0-30 points)
  const weightScore = (gradeWeight / 100) * 30;

  // Workload consideration (0-20 points)
  let workloadScore = 0;
  if (estimatedHours > 10) workloadScore = 20;
  else if (estimatedHours > 5) workloadScore = 15;
  else if (estimatedHours > 2) workloadScore = 10;
  else workloadScore = 5;

  // Current grade impact (0-10 points)
  const gradeImpactScore = (100 - currentGrade) / 10;

  return urgencyScore + weightScore + workloadScore + gradeImpactScore;
}
```
