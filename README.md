## 🎯 Overview

DeadlineIQ is an intelligent assignment management system that helps students prioritize their workload using AI-driven insights. No more stress about what to work on next - let the AI do the thinking while you focus on learning.

**🏆 Built for:** ASU 48-Hour App Challenge
**🎨 Focus:** Best UI/UX Design

## 🚨 The Problem

Students face overwhelming challenges managing multiple assignments:
- 😰 **Overwhelm:** Too many deadlines to track manually
- 🤔 **Poor Prioritization:** Not knowing which assignments to tackle first
- 😓 **Stress:** Uncertainty about workload and time management
- ⏰ **Missed Deadlines:** Lost track of important due dates

## ✨ The Solution

DeadlineIQ uses an **AI-powered priority algorithm** that analyzes:
- ⏱️ **Time Urgency** - How close is the deadline?
- 📊 **Grade Weight** - Impact on your final grade
- 💪 **Workload** - Estimated hours needed
- 📈 **Current Grade** - Struggling classes get higher priority

### Priority Levels

- 🟠 **High** (60-79 pts) - Should be your next focus

Urgency:
- < 24 hours: 40 points
- < 48 hours: 30 points
- < 72 hours: 20 points
- < 1 week: 10 points

Weight: (gradeWeight / 100) × 30

Workload:
- > 10 hours: 20 points
- 5-10 hours: 15 points
- 2-5 hours: 10 points
- < 2 hours: 5 points

Grade Impact: (100 - currentGrade) / 10
